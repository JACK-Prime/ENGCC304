## 🚀 About This Jedi Coder

**Name:** Natthakit Rodruean  
**Student ID:** 68543210007-9  
**Course:** ENGCC304 - Computer Programming  
**Mission:** Exploring the infinite possibilities of code, one algorithm at a time

## 🌟 "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."

...there was a young programmer who believed that **code is the force that binds the digital universe together**. Like Stephen Hawking exploring black holes, I explore the endless depths of programming logic. Like a Jedi mastering the Force, I'm mastering the art of code.

## 💫 My Programming Journey

```ascii
    🌌 THE FORCE OF CODE 🌌
    
    BEGIN_JOURNEY()
    │
    ├─ 🔹 Variables & Data Types → "These are not the droids you're looking for"
    ├─ 🔹 Loops & Conditions → "Do or do not, there is no try"
    ├─ 🔹 Functions & Methods → "The Force will be with you, always"
    ├─ 🔹 Arrays & Objects → "I find your lack of faith disturbing"
    └─ 🔹 Advanced Concepts → "The Force is strong with this one"
    
    END_JOURNEY()
```


## 🎯 Current Mission Objectives

- [ ] **Master the Fundamentals** → Building strong foundations like the Death Star (but for good!)
- [ ] **Explore Data Structures** → Mapping the galaxy of algorithms
- [ ] **Understand OOP** → Creating objects more complex than C-3PO
- [ ] **Database Mastery** → Storing data across multiple star systems
- [ ] **Web Development** → Building interfaces smoother than the Millennium Falcon

## 🔮 Stephen Hawking's Wisdom for Programmers

> *"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change."*  
> **→ Code must evolve, debug, and improve continuously**

> *"We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star."*  
> **→ But we can write extraordinary code!**

> *"My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe."*  
> **→ My goal: Complete understanding of programming!**
